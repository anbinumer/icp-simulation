    title: "Initial Assessment",
    description: "Sarah Chen, 28, was found unconscious at her desk by cleaning staff. Her colleagues mention she's been complaining of severe headaches for the past week. Initial assessment reveals: GCS 13 (E3V4M6), BP 142/88, HR 72, and subtle right pupillary enlargement. A CT scan reveals cerebral edema in the right temporal lobe with early signs of midline shift.",

        text: "Administer mannitol immediately", 
        outcome: "Negative", 
        feedback: "Administering mannitol without proper assessment of ICP and without doctor's orders is premature. Sarah's condition deteriorates as the treatment was not appropriate for her current status." 
      },
      { 
        text: "Establish baseline neurological assessment", 
        outcome: "Positive", 
        feedback: "Good choice. You thoroughly document pupil size/reactivity, GCS components, and vital signs, establishing an important baseline for monitoring changes."

      { 
        text: "Call the neurosurgeon immediately", 
        outcome: "Neutral", 
        feedback: "The neurosurgeon appreciates being informed but suggests continuous monitoring and establishing a baseline assessment first before determining if surgical intervention is needed." 
      },
      { 
        text: "Position patient flat to increase cerebral perfusion", 
        outcome: "Negative", 
        feedback: "Positioning the patient flat may increase ICP. Sarah's ICP increases, and her condition worsens. Head elevation of 30Â° would have been more appropriate."

    description: "30 minutes later, you notice Sarah's right pupil is now 4mm and sluggish compared to her left at 2.5mm. Her BP is rising to 158/90, while her heart rate has dropped to 68. Her breathing pattern is becoming irregular.",
    question: "What is your next action?",
    options: [
      { 
        text: "Continue monitoring and reassess in 30 minutes", 
        outcome: "Negative", 
        feedback: "These are progressive signs of increasing ICP and potential early Cushing's response. Delaying intervention allows Sarah's condition to worsen significantly."

      { 
        text: "Notify the physician immediately of these changes", 
        outcome: "Positive", 
        feedback: "Correct. These changes suggest decompensation and early Cushing's triad. The physician orders immediate interventions including possible osmotic therapy and preparation for possible intubation."

        text: "Administer oxygen via nasal cannula", 
        outcome: "Neutral", 
        feedback: "While oxygenation is important, it doesn't address the underlying ICP issue. You've helped prevent hypoxia but still need to address the changing neurological status."

      { 
        text: "Lower the head of the bed to improve cerebral blood flow", 
        outcome: "Negative",

    title: "Emergency Management",
    description: "The physician has ordered hyperventilation, mannitol, and preparation for possible surgical intervention. Sarah's BP is now 165/92, HR 58, and her left arm no longer withdraws to painful stimuli, though her right side remains more responsive.",

    options: [
      { 
        text: "Administer mannitol first, then prepare for hyperventilation", 
        outcome: "Positive", 
        feedback: "Good prioritization. Mannitol will help reduce ICP through osmotic action, while preparing for controlled hyperventilation addresses the critical situation. Sarah's condition stabilizes temporarily." 
      },
      { 
        text: "Focus on hyperventilation first to quickly reduce ICP", 
        outcome: "Neutral", 
        feedback: "While hyperventilation can quickly reduce ICP, prolonged hyperventilation without addressing the underlying issue can lead to cerebral ischemia. Sarah stabilizes initially but may face complications." 
      },
      { 
        text: "Call for immediate surgical intervention before other measures", 
        outcome: "Neutral", 
        feedback: "Surgical intervention may eventually be necessary, but trying medical management first is standard protocol. The neurosurgeon agrees to come but suggests continuing medical management meanwhile."

      { 
        text: "Repeat the CT scan before any interventions", 
        outcome: "Negative", 
        feedback: "Delaying interventions to repeat imaging when there are clear clinical signs of deterioration wastes valuable time. Sarah's condition worsens significantly during transport to CT."

      { 
        text: "Increase mannitol dosage without physician order", 
        outcome: "Negative", 
        feedback: "Increasing medication dosage without orders is outside nursing scope and could cause dangerous fluid/electrolyte imbalances. Sarah develops complications from inappropriate dosing."

        text: "Prepare operating room for immediate decompressive craniectomy", 
        outcome: "Neutral", 
        feedback: "While surgical intervention will likely be needed, preparing the OR is appropriate but shouldn't delay immediate interventions like airway management. The OR team appreciates the heads-up but reminds you to focus on immediate stabilization." 
      },
      { 
        text: "Administer sedatives to reduce agitation", 
        outcome: "Negative", 
        feedback: "Sedatives may mask neurological symptoms and could further depress respiratory drive. Without securing the airway first, this intervention leads to respiratory depression and worsening hypercapnia."

    question: "What is your priority in preparing for transfer to the OR?",
    options: [
      { 
        text: "Ensure all documentation is complete before transfer", 
        outcome: "Negative",

        text: "Disconnect the ICP monitoring device for transport", 
        outcome: "Negative",

        text: "Prepare family for possible poor outcome", 
        outcome: "Neutral",
